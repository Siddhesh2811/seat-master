- App is assumed to be admin-only by default
- Focus on correctness, stability, and clean structure
- App must run successfully in Replit

TECH STACK
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: Use JSON or in-memory storage (MongoDB optional but not required)
- Styling: CSS Grid / Flexbox

PROJECT STRUCTURE
- Single repository
- /server → Express backend
- /client → React frontend
- Backend runs on port 3000
- Frontend runs on port 5173 (or auto-configured)
- App auto-starts correctly in Replit

CORE FEATURES

EVENT MANAGEMENT
- Create, edit, delete multiple events
- Event fields:
  - Event Name
  - Event Date
  - Venue Name
- List events on a dashboard
- Open seating editor for any event

SEATING CONFIGURATION
For each event, allow admin to configure:

1. ZONES
- Zones are selectable:
  - Front
  - Middle
  - Back

2. SECTIONS PER ZONE
- Sections are selectable per zone:
  - Left
  - Center
  - Right

3. ROWS PER SECTION
- Rows are created dynamically
- Each row has:
  - Row label (A, B, C… or custom)
  - Number of seats (may vary per row)
  - Optional aisle split (example: insert passage after 6 seats)

4. PASSAGES (AISLES)
- Visual passages must exist:
  - Between sections
  - Inside rows at split position
  - Between zones

SEAT GENERATION RULES
- Seats are auto-generated from configuration
- Each seat must have a unique ID:
  ZONE-SECTION-ROW-SEATNUMBER
- Seat states:
  - Available
  - Reserved
  - Blocked

VISUAL SEAT LAYOUT
- Render a fully visual seating layout similar to movie theatre / auditorium seating
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox
- Layout hierarchy:
  Zone → Section → Row → Seat
- Render passages as empty gaps
- Seat color coding:
  - Green → Available
  - Red → Reserved
  - Grey → Blocked
- Labels for zones, sections, and rows must be visible

SEAT MANAGEMENT
- Clicking a seat cycles through:
  Available → Reserved → Blocked → Available
- Seat state must be saved and persisted

UI PAGES
- Event Dashboard (list + create events)
- Seating Configuration Page
- Visual Seat Management Page

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- Clean, readable code
- Reusable React components
- Clear comments for key logic
- Error handling for invalid configurations
- Responsive layout (desktop-first is fine)

FINAL DELIVERABLE
- Fully working app
- No authentication
- Stable runtime in Replit
- Clear README explaining:
